    "\n",
    "* use my library dash_database for sharing data between callbacks<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "* put your callbacks in functions - as I did in the examples before - so you can import them from other modules\n",
    "\n",
    "* put the ids of the components with which user will interact in variables as I did in the examples before (this helps organization and troubleshooting)\n",
    "\n",
    "* if you create your app as a package remember to install it in editable mode e.g. \"pip install -e data_cleaner_app\" to reflect any changes upon next import\n",

    "<sup>1</sup>_Please beware that concurrent requests are actually done as a queue. If you are storing big datasets (> 1GB) and/or have a good amount of simultaneous users (> 20) then either consider redis or making one DashDatabase per user could do the trick. If you do that with success please tell me I could rewrite dash_database so each user has its own database and we do not loose any convenience in the usage (would probably not work on memory but performance would still be good as seen in the performance tests in the repo)._"
