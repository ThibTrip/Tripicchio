# presentation_data_cleaning

This is a presentation I did for the Python Meetup group Freiburg in 2018.

I have since then acquired a lot of new knowledge and some of the libraries have evolved. So please keep in mind that 
parts of the code could be done more efficiently or they could be obsolete or irrelevant.
